					I didn't start as a web developer. Previously, I pursued a{" "}
					<strong>PhD in Graph Theory</strong> in Montpellier, France (see below
					for a list of my publications).
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2019, I relocated to Orléans, France, taking on a role as a{" "}
					<strong>Temporary Lecturer</strong> at the University. Amidst the
					COVID-19 Pandemic, teachers, including myself, had to swiftly adapt to
					remote teaching. This prompted me to explore solutions for providing
					students with the best possible learning experience using available
					technology. Consequently, I began developing semi-autodidactically,
					crafting <strong>simple webpages</strong> to assist students, such as
					in manipulating data structures.
				</p>

				<p>
					Subsequently, during my postdoctoral position in Prague, I
					collaborated with my friend Lucas Isenmann to create a website
					enabling graph-theory researchers and teachers to collaboratively draw
					graphs: <strong>GraCoOn was born.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Fast forward to today, I find myself in Rome, accompanied by my
					wonderful dog named Pùa, and{" "}
					<strong>I am actively seeking a web developer position.</strong>
