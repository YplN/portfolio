					I wasn't always a web developer. Previously, I did a{" "}
					<strong>PhD in Graph Theory</strong> (see below a list of my
					publications).
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2019, I moved to Orléans, France and started a new position as a{" "}
					<strong>Temporary Lecturer</strong> at the University. During the
					COVID-19 Pandemic, we -the teachers- had to quickly adapt our working
					habits to remote teaching. This led me to try to find solutions to
					allow my students the best possible learning experience technology
					allowed us. I therefore started to develop in semi-autodidact{" "}
					<strong>simple webpages</strong> to help students, for example to
					manipulate some data structures.
				</p>

				<p>
					Then, during my postdoctoral position in Prague, I started to develop
					with my friend Lucas Isenmann a website to allow graph-theory
					researchers and teacher to draw graph collaboratively:{" "}
					<strong>GraCoOn was born.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Flash forward, I am now in Rome, I have a wonderful dog named Pùa, and{" "}
					<strong>I am looking for a job position as a web developer.</strong>

				{/* <p>At the time, I was in charge of teaching the basics of programming to non-computer science students. In my search for a programming language suited to this course (i.e. demanding, but not too complex, while still being able to do cool things quickly), I came across the Processing foundation, and in particular P5.js. I immediately fell in love with this library, which perfectly met my expectations.
